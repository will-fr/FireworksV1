# FireworksV1 is a Tetris-like puzzle game where players

# Game Grid & Setup
# Grid Size: 7 columns × 8 rows
# Players: 2 players (human vs human, human vs CPU, or CPU vs CPU)
# Block Size: 16×16 pixels per shell

# SHELL TYPES : The game features 6 different shell types:
# - Bottom Shell (Type 1): Used to create big rockets
# - Top Shell (Type 2): Used to create big rockets
# - Green Shell (Type 3): Standard colored shell
# - Red Shell (Type 4): Standard colored shell
# - Blue Shell (Type 5): Standard colored shell
# - Yellow Shell (Type 6): Standard colored shell

# SHELL STATES: Each shell has one of three states:
# - WAITING: Just spawned, not yet falling
# - FALLING: Currently dropping down the grid
# - DROPPED: Settled at the bottom or on another shell

# PLAYER CONTROLS
# Move Left/Right: Navigate between columns 0-6
# lift: lift the content of the current column, with the idea to move it. All the dropped shells are moved up
# if the player moves left while lifting, his current column and the column directly to its left are swapped.
# if the player moves right while lifting, the current column and the column directly to its right are swapped.
# Force Gravity: accelerate the game loop, making all falling shells drop faster.

# Core Game Mechanics
# 1. Shell Spawning
# Every second, new shells spawn at random columns in the top row
# Shells start in WAITING state, then become FALLING
# Number of shells per batch can increase based on "junk" received
# 2. Gravity & Movement
# Shells fall down one row at a time until they hit something
# When a shell can't fall further, it becomes DROPPED

# 3. Matching & Popping
# Simple Match: When a falling shell lands on a dropped shell of the same type → Both shells pop → +10 points
# Big Rocket Creation: When a TOP_SHELL falls and finds a BOTTOM_SHELL below it → Creates a big firework → Higher points
# Single Pop: If a TOP_SHELL can't find a BOTTOM_SHELL → Pops alone → Basic points

# 4. Data access and player movement
# The Player class is responsible for managing the player's state, including their position, score, and the shells they control.
# The CPU player will need to access this data to make informed decisions.
# you can get the column you're in by accessing the player.get_column(). It will return an int between 0 (you're on the left) and 6 (you're on the right)
# you can move left or right by calling player.move_left() or player.move_right().
# to flip columns, you need to lift it first, then move to the left or to the right.  
# if you need to access the shells controlled by the player, you can use player_manager.get_shells_grid()
# getting a continuous update of the shells grid will be important for the CPU's decision-making process.
# you can flip the current column and the adjacent column by calling player.flip_left() or player.flip_right().


# 5. Column Management
# The combination of lifting and moving will be key to rearrange the dropped columns in the desired state. 
# Strategic positioning is key to creating matches
# Scoring System
# Simple Pop: 10 points (POP_SCORE)
# Big Fireworks: Variable points based on size (FIREWORK_SCORE array: 10, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000)
# Bigger rockets = Higher scores
# Multiplayer Mechanics
# When a player creates fireworks, the opponent receives "junk"
# Junk increases the number of shells spawned in the opponent's next batch
# This creates competitive pressure and attack/defense dynamics
# Win/Lose Conditions
# Game Over: When shells reach the top row (row 7) of any column
# Winner: The last player standing (opponent's grid fills up first)
# Strategic Elements
# Defensive: Clear shells before grid fills up
# Offensive: Create big fireworks to send junk to opponent
# Positioning: Move to optimal columns for matches
# Timing: Use gravity forcing and flipping strategically
# Rocket Building: Combine TOP_SHELL + BOTTOM_SHELL for maximum impact


# the top_dropped_shells array is just the current top dropped shells for all columns, based on the cpu_shell_grids. 
# so by lifting and moving the columns, you will update the top_dropped_shells array as well.. 
# IMPORTANT: The match will only happen if the waiting shells and top dropped shells are aligned correctly, meaning their index
# in the array must correspond.


# Your priorities are in this order. 
# 1. Avoid losing the game (you lose the game when a shell reaches the top row). 
# 2. Maximize your scoring. 


# To perform the strategy, follow these steps : 
# 1. Identify all the arrangements that can be done for the 7 columns of the shells_grid. 
# 2. For each of the arrangement, perform a scoring function and only keep the best scoring option. 
# 3. Choose the best arrangement and execute the necessary actions to achieve it.

# ARRANGEMENT GENERATION - Step 1 of Strategy
# ================================

## Generate all possible column arrangements the CPU can achieve
## An arrangement is represented as an array of column indices [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
## where each position represents which original column goes in that position.
##
## Example arrangements:
## - [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]: No change (current state)
## - [1,0,2,3,4,5,6]: Swap columns 0 and 1
## - [0,2,1,3,4,5,6]: Swap columns 1 and 2
##
## OPTIMIZED GENERATION: Generates strategic arrangements only
## Instead of 5040 permutations, focus on meaningful moves:
## 1. Current state (do nothing)
## 2. Adjacent swaps (immediate moves)
## 3. Match-focused arrangements (only when matches are possible)
